    "- Problem Statement: Analyzing Weather Data from OpenWeatherMap API\n",
    "- Dataset: Weather data retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API\n",
    "- Description: The goal is to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data\n",
    "for a specific location and perform data modeling and visualization to analyze weather\n",
    "patterns over time.\n",
    "#### Tasks to Perform:\n",
    "1. Register and obtain API key from OpenWeatherMap.\n",
    "2. Interact with the OpenWeatherMap API using the API key to retrieve weather data for\n",
    "a specific location.\n",
    "3. Extract relevant weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and\n",
    "precipitation from the API response.\n",
    "4. Clean and preprocess the retrieved data, handling missing values or inconsistent\n",
    "formats.\n",
    "5. Perform data modeling to analyze weather patterns, such as calculating average\n",
    "temperature, maximum/minimum values, or trends over time.\n",
    "6. Visualize the weather data using appropriate plots, such as line charts, bar plots, or\n",
    "scatter plots, to represent temperature changes, precipitation levels, or wind speed\n",
    "variations.\n",
    "7. Apply data aggregation techniques to summarize weather statistics by specific time\n",
    "periods (e.g., daily, monthly, seasonal).\n",
    "8. Incorporate geographical information, if available, to create maps or geospatial\n",
    "visualizations representing weather patterns across different locations.\n",
    "9. Explore and visualize relationships between weather attributes, such as temperature\n",
    "and humidity, using correlation plots or heatmaps."
