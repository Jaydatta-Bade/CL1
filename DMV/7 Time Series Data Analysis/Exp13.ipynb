    "### Time Series Data Analysis\n",
    "- Problem statement: Analysis and Visualization of Stock Market Data\n",
    "- Dataset: \"Stock_Prices.csv\"\n",
    "- Description: The dataset contains historical stock price data for a particular company over a\n",
    "period of time. It includes attributes such as date, closing price, volume, and other relevant\n",
    "features. \n",
    "- The goal is to perform time series data analysis on the stock price data to identify\n",
    "trends, patterns, and potential predictors, as well as build models to forecast future stock\n",
    "prices.\n",
    "#### Tasks to Perform:\n",
    "1. Import the \"Stock_Prices.csv\" dataset.\n",
    "2. Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.\n",
    "3. Ensure that the date column is in the appropriate format (e.g., datetime) for time series\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "4. Plot line charts or time series plots to visualize the historical stock price trends over\n",
    "time.\n",
    "5. Calculate and plot moving averages or rolling averages to identify the underlying\n",
    "trends and smooth out noise.\n",
    "6. Perform seasonality analysis to identify periodic patterns in the stock prices, such as\n",
    "weekly, monthly, or yearly fluctuations.\n",
    "7. Analyze and plot the correlation between the stock prices and other variables, such as\n",
    "trading volume or market indices.\n",
    "8. Use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models or exponential\n",
    "smoothing models to forecast future stock prices.\n"
